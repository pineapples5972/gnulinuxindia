      <title>Managing dotfiles</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Dotfiles&amp;rdquo; are a way to store configuration of various packages and programs on your system. They are named so because of the &amp;lsquo;.&amp;rsquo; that precedes their names to keep them hidden.
These dot files make up the system of a user and in case the system crashes into an unrecoverable state, the user might lose all their configurations for all of their programs. This is an inconvenience and can be easily avoided by managing your dotfiles properly.</description>
